# Example Project: Pull Request Practice

Welcome to the **Pull Request Practice** project! This project is designed to help new developers learn how to collaborate on GitHub by forking repositories, making changes, and submitting pull requests.

## Objective
The goal is to:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Fix the bug in the code.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

## Problem Description
The `main.py` script contains a function `calculate_average(numbers)` which calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, there is an issue in the `main()` function.

### Hint:
- The error occurs when trying to calculate the average of an empty list. Look at the line where `numbers` is defined and how the `calculate_average()` function handles it.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Fix the bug in `main.py`:
   - Make sure the program handles the issue gracefully (e.g., by checking if the list is empty).
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful message.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request to this repository.

## Example Pull Request Message
When submitting your pull request, include a message like:
